## Task: Remove Unused Parallel Processing Code

This CLI tool was originally designed for standalone batch processing with worker pools and parallel execution. However, it is now primarily used as a library imported by AWS Lambda functions for single-video processing.

**The Problem:**
- AWS Lambda + SQS already provides concurrency and queuing
- Each Lambda processes ONE video per invocation
- The parallel processing infrastructure (worker pools, job queues, Tor coordinator) is NOT used by Lambda
- This unused code increases Lambda package size and adds unnecessary complexity

## Your Task

1. **Analyze the codebase** and identify all parallel processing components:
   - `parallel_processor.py` - Worker pool management
   - `video_job.py` - Job queue logic (keep data models if Lambda uses them)
   - `video_processor.py` - Multi-video coordinator (if it duplicates pipeline logic)
   - Tor coordinator in `tor_transcript_fetcher.py` (keep base fetcher, remove coordinator)
   - `docker-compose.parallel.yml` - Parallel Docker setup
   - CLI flags: `--parallel`, `--workers` in `cli.py`
   - Thread locks and worker factories in `cli.py`

2. **Verify Lambda usage** by checking what components Lambda actually imports

3. **Create a refactoring plan** that:
   - Removes all parallel processing code
   - Keeps core single-video processing pipeline
   - Simplifies CLI to single-video mode only
   - Updates documentation

4. **Benefits of this refactoring:**
   - Smaller Lambda package → faster cold starts
   - Clearer code → easier maintenance
   - No confusion about what code is actually used
   - Prevents threading bugs in Lambda context

5. **Core components to KEEP** (used by Lambda):
   - `processing_pipeline.py` - Single video pipeline
   - `langgraph_workflow.py` - Workflow orchestration
   - `study_notes_generator.py` - AI generation
   - `transcript_provider.py` - Transcript extraction
   - `tor_transcript_fetcher.py` - Base Tor client (remove coordinator)

Please analyze the codebase, create a detailed refactoring plan, and estimate the impact. Focus on making this a clean, simple, single-video processing library for Lambda.
