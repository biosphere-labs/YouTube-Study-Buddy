# Sessions Directory

This directory contains session-based study notes generated by YouTube Study Buddy.

## Structure

Each session creates a unique folder:
```
sessions/
  session_abc12345/
    <subject>/
      *.md         # Study notes
      *.pdf        # Exported PDFs (if enabled)
    processing_log.json
    exit_nodes.json
```

## Session Management

- Each user session gets a unique 8-character ID
- All notes and PDFs for that session are stored in the session folder
- Use the "Download All Files (ZIP)" button in the Streamlit UI to download the complete session

## Deployment Notes

For Streamlit Cloud or public deployments:
- Sessions are ephemeral and stored only during the app runtime
- Users must download their ZIP before closing the browser/session
- Sessions are NOT persisted across app restarts

For Docker deployments:
- Sessions persist in the `./sessions/` directory on the host
- You can manually archive old sessions as needed
